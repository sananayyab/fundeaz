# Fundeaz

Fundeaz, or fund this, is a money management app that uses the Zero-based budgeting to
help you manage your income.

In order to help you budget, you allocate your money into categories. categories can be
thought of as a group in which a part of your spending goes into.

some example of categories are:
- Groceries
- Transportation
- Hobbies
- Outings

you further on categorize your categories using groups, grouping categories together can help
you get a bigger picture of your spending

some example of groups are:
- House
- Work
- Family
- Goals

you do not have to limit yourself with this format so feel free to customize and group your categories as you wish
